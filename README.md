> Open-source, npm-installable streaming platform that turns DDEX deliveries into a complete music service.

Stardust DSP enables anyone to deploy a fully functional, DDEX-compliant streaming platform in minutes. Receive ERN deliveries, process them automatically, and provide a complete music streaming experience. **Every feature, every protocol, every line of code is MIT licensed and free forever.**

## 🎯 True Open Source Philosophy

**Stardust DSP is 100% open source.** The entire platform is MIT licensed with no paid tiers, no enterprise edition, and no artificial limitations. You get a complete, production-ready streaming platform with ALL ingestion protocols (FTP, SFTP, S3, API), full ERN processing, adaptive streaming, and everything needed to run a professional music service.

We believe in democratizing music streaming technology. The core platform is and will always be completely free and fully functional.

### Why This Matters
- **No vendor lock-in**: Deploy and use forever without paying a cent
- **No artificial limits**: No track caps, no watermarks, no time bombs
- **Complete functionality**: Every feature needed for professional streaming
- **True community ownership**: Fork it, modify it, deploy it - it's yours
- **Perfect for testing**: Ideal companion for testing Stardust Distro deliveries
