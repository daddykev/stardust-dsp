> Open-source, npm-installable streaming platform that turns DDEX deliveries into a complete music service.

Stardust DSP enables anyone to deploy a fully functional, DDEX-compliant streaming platform in minutes. Receive ERN deliveries, process them automatically, and provide a complete music streaming experience.

## Introduction

**Stardust DSP is open-source software.** The entire platform is MIT licensed with no paid tiers, no enterprise edition, and no artificial limitations. You get a complete, production-ready streaming platform with ALL ingestion protocols (FTP, SFTP, S3, API), full ERN processing, adaptive streaming, and everything needed to run a professional music service.

We believe in democratizing music streaming technology. The core platform is and will always be completely free and fully functional.

### Why This Matters

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install and Deploy
```bash
# Create your streaming platform
npx stardust-dsp create my-dsp

# Navigate to project
cd my-dsp

# Initialize Firebase (free tier available)
stardust-dsp init

# Start development server
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:5173

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy
# Your platform is live! 🚀
```

### Using the CLI Tool
```bash
# Available commands
stardust-dsp create <name>       # Create new streaming platform
stardust-dsp init                # Initialize Firebase configuration
stardust-dsp deploy              # Deploy to Firebase
stardust-dsp configure           # Configure ingestion settings
stardust-dsp dev                 # Start development server
stardust-dsp deliveries          # Manage DDEX deliveries
```

### Test the Complete Workflow
```bash
# Send test delivery from Stardust Distro
stardust-distro deliver \
  --target=https://us-central1-my-dsp.cloudfunctions.net/receiveDelivery \
  --release=test-album

# Check ingestion status
stardust-dsp deliveries list

# Monitor processing
# Visit http://localhost:5173/ingestion

# Browse the catalog
# Visit http://localhost:5173/catalog

# Play the music!
# Click any release to start streaming
```

## 🏗️ Ingestion Architecture

### Direct Pipeline Processing
The platform uses a **direct pipeline architecture** for processing DDEX deliveries, chosen for its simplicity, debuggability, and cost efficiency:

```javascript
// Processing flow with transaction-based locking
exports.processDeliveryPipeline = async (deliveryId) => {
  // 1. Lock delivery to prevent concurrent processing
  // 2. Check/wait for file transfers if needed
  // 3. Parse ERN XML directly
  // 4. Validate with DDEX Workbench
  // 5. Process releases and assets
  // 6. Generate acknowledgment
  // 7. Update status and unlock
};
```

### Processing Status Flow
```
received → pending → waiting_for_files → files_ready → parsing → 
validating → processing_releases → completed (or failed/cancelled)
```

### Key Architectural Features
- **Transaction-based locking**: Prevents race conditions and duplicate processing
- **Scheduled processing**: Runs every minute to handle queued deliveries
- **File transfer jobs**: Separate system for handling large audio/image files
- **MD5 validation**: Ensures file integrity during transfers
- **Retry logic**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **30-50% faster** than pub/sub approaches for typical workloads

### Scheduled Functions
- **processPendingDeliveries** (every minute): Main processing queue
- **processPendingFileTransfers** (every 5 minutes): File transfer handling
- **cleanupStuckDeliveries** (every 30 minutes): Recovery from stuck states
